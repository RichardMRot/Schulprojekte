				<h2>Roman Republic</h2>
				<p><span>The ancient Roman Republic was a political era in the history of Rome that lasted from 509 BC.

				Rome developed from a monarchy to a republic and established political institutions, 
				which were of great importance for the later development of the Roman Empire.</span>

				<span>The foundation of the Roman Republic was initiated by the overthrow of the last Roman king Tarquinius Superbus 
				in 509 BC.</span> <span>In his place, a government was established with two consuls,

				<span>The Roman Republic was based on a system of checks and balances that served to,

				<span>The senate, consisting of distinguished men, played an important role in advising 
				the consuls and the formulation of laws. The popular assemblies, which consisted of Roman citizens, 
				had the right to pass laws and make political decisions.</span>

				<span>During the republican period, Rome expanded its territory and gradually conquered other parts of Italy.</span> 
				<span>However, there were also internal conflicts and social tensions within Roman society.</span> 
				<span>The Roman Republic experienced a series of conflicts known as the Roman Wars, including

				<h2>Roman Empire</h2>

				<span>Under Augustus and the following emperors, the Roman Empire reached its peak.</span> 
				<span>The empire stretched from Britain in the west to the Middle East and North Africa in the east and south. </span>
				<span>Roman rule brought stability, peace and comprehensive administration to the conquered territories.</span><br>
				
				<span>The Roman Empire was a mixture of republic and monarchy. Although there were emperors, the senate retained

				legal systems was well developed,</span> <span>and the Roman infrastructure, including roads, bridges 
				and aqueducts, was impressive.</span><br>
				
				<span>The Roman Empire was known for its military strength. The Roman legions were disciplined 
				and well trained, which helped them to conquer and control large parts of Europe.</span> <span>The expansion 
				of the empire led to a cultural fusion, as the Romans took over ideas, technologies and traditions from the conquered peoples.

				<span>Over time, however, the Roman Empire began to struggle with internal and external challenges.</span> 
				<span>Corruption, economic problems and political instability weakened the empire.</span> 
				<span>Roman society was characterised by social differences, and riots and uprisings were not uncommon.</span><br>
				
				<span>In the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire began to fall apart. It was divided into a western and an 
				eastern half,</span> <span>whereby the capital of the west was moved to Ravenna and the capital of the east remained in

				<h2>Middle Ages</h2>
				<p><span>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, a new era began in Italy,

				<span>Italy became the scene of conflicts between different powers and kingdoms.</span>

				<span>During the Middle Ages, there were also numerous warlike conflicts in Italy. The cities and

				<span>In the 13th century, the members of the Hohenstaufen family, especially Frederick II,

				<h2>Modern Age</h2>
				<p><span>After the Middle Ages, Italy became a territory with many political and territorial fragmentations.</span>
