			<p>Italy is a bit over <span class="hoverText">302,000km² in size, most of which is on 
			the peninsula</span>. From north to south, Italy stretches about 1,200km.
			The length of the coast (~7,500km) is longer than the national border (~1,900km). In addition
			Italy borders six countries: <span class="hoverText">In the north France, Switzerland, Austria
			and Slovenia, in the interior the Vatican City and San Marino.</span> <span class="hoverText">The longest 
			border with Italy is Switzerland, with 734km, followed by France with 488km, then Austria with 430km,
